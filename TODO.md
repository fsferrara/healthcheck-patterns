[x] Docker healthchecks?
https://howchoo.com/g/zwjhogrkywe/how-to-add-a-health-check-to-your-docker-container
https://www.katacoda.com/courses/prometheus/docker-metrics
```
echo '{ "metrics-addr" : "127.0.0.1:9323", "experimental" : true }' > /etc/docker/daemon.json
systemctl restart docker
```
The metrics endpoint will be accessible once Docker has begun. You can see the raw metrics 
using 
```
curl localhost:9323/metrics
```

# Research 
[x] Prometheus docs (Katacoda?)
[x] Envoy docs (Katacoda?)
https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.13.1/start/sandboxes/front_proxy#running-the-sandbox
[x] Watch patterns resiliency
[x] Insert Envoy with metrics for better observability

# Ideation
[ ] Full patterns map

# LHF
[ ] e2e from Docker container for better portability
[x] Makefile more variables
[ ] Rename service project
[x] Build image first then start app
