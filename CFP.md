# CFP draft

I guess every developer heard a few things about health checks.
If you're lucky enough, you've also worked in a project where they were implemented and used.
But why do we need health checks after all? How should I implement them properly to accomplish the desired goal?

In this talk I'm going to go through the various implementations and compare them to each other,
 so everyone can pick the one which is the most suitalbe for the given situation.

 At the end of this talk developers will be able to pick the most suitable healt check pattern for their need, and hopefully sleep better while their service is running in production.
